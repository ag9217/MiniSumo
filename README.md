# MiniSumo
**Complete mini sumo robot with a custom made PCB and chassis from scratch.** The custom PCB uses breakout boards for the motor driver and nRF24l01, mainly due to the chip shortage.

Broadly, this reposity consists of:
* PCB hardware design (developed using KiCAD)
* Low-level drivers and firmware (for the STM32 platform of MCUs)
* STEP file for robot chassis (designed in Fusion 360)
